UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING


Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes and clusters data without labeled outcomes. Unlike supervised learning, where algorithms are trained on input-output pairs, unsupervised learning focuses on finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. Common techniques include:

Clustering: Grouping similar data points together, such as KMeans and hierarchical clustering.

Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features while preserving important information, like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual data points that differ significantly from the majority.

Unsupervised learning is useful for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and feature extraction, making it valuable in various applications, from customer segmentation to image processing.


CLUSTERING ALGORITHM

Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning techniques used to group similar data points into clusters based on their features. Here are some common clustering algorithms:

KMeans: Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest centroid and updates centroids based on the mean of the assigned points.

Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent nested clusters. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down), allowing for a flexible number of clusters.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Groups points that are closely packed together while marking points in low-density regions as outliers. Itâ€™s effective for clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
